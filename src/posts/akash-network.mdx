## Akash Network

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, but here is why I’m bullish on Akash Network($AKT)

1. Akash Network is a decentralized cloud computing platform that aims to provide a faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative to traditional cloud services. It leverages the world's underutilized server capacity to create a secure, low-cost, and censorship-resistant cloud infrastructure.
2. Unique Selling Point: Akash Network's unique decentralized model guarantees high efficiency and affordability, distinguishing it in the cloud computing market.
3. Cost-Efficiency: Akash allows for unused cloud capacity to be turned into a marketplace, which drives down costs. GCP, Azure, and AWS have a monopoly, and the barrier to entry makes it hard for competition. Here is a cost breakdown by Binance research

4. Scalability: The Akash Network is designed to automatically scale applications, ensuring seamless performance even during peak times.
5. Community: Akash has an active, growing community that is supportive and dedicated to the project's success. They have a strong community on Reddit and Discord along with educational resources on Youtube and an open source GitHub.
6. Potential: As more businesses move towards decentralization and blockchain solutions, Akash Network is well-positioned for growth. Companies that host open source models like [Replicate.ai](http://Replicate.ai) could quadruple their margins by deploying on Akash.
7. Improvements: In order for real growth, Akash still needs a catalyst. In my opinion the skyrocketing costs of gpu time and the AI boom will do a lot for this chain. But, in order for real success, they need to gain trust and prove that they can provide the same uptime and efficiency as large providers.
8. Tokenomics: All of $AKT has been unlocked, and they just recently implemented their fee structure. AKT is inflationary at about 13% to incentivize adoption, but the inflation rate exponentially decays daily and is supposed to half every two years.
9. Because providers will receive incentives for maintaining high utilization rates on their CPU/GPUs, this will encourage them to bid even lower on leases, further reducing costs for tenants.
